                <h2>ROSARIO</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in a small Argentine city where dreams grew on dusty streets. 
                    Lionel Messi carried a vision bigger than the world could see. 
                    At eleven, doctors diagnosed a growth hormone deficiency. 
                    They doubted his size, but never measured his will.

                <p>
                    At thirteen, he left everything behind. A napkin became a contract. 
                    Barcelona became home. La Masia molded the boy into something the world 
                    had never seen—a magician in football boots.

                    Goals that defied physics. Dribbles that froze defenders. Moments that stopped time. 
                    The Camp Nou witnessed greatness every week. Four Champions League titles. 
                    Multiple La Liga crowns. The world watched a legend being written in real-time.

            Four World Cup attempts. Three Copa América finals lost. The weight of a nation 
            on his shoulders. Tears in New Jersey. Retirement announced, then reversed. 
            Critics questioned if he could ever lift the trophy that mattered most.

            Brazil 2021. The Maracanã held its breath. After 28 years, Argentina lifted 
            the Copa América. Messi finally wore a winner's smile in the blue and white. 
            Tears again—but this time, of joy.
